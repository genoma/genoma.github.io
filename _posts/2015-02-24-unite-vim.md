description: Unite.vim and Command-t a short comparison
---

Yesterday i’ve changed a couple of things on my _vimrc_ and  swapped [Command-T](https://wincent.com/products/command-t "Command-T") for [Unite.vim](https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim "Unite.vim"). The reason behind this change is that i wanted to test [Neovim](http://neovim.org/ "Neovim") and Command-T requires Vim compiled with [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/ "Ruby") support (aka **“+ruby”**) which is still not available with Neovim. _Unite.vim_ requires just [Lua](http://www.lua.org/ "Lua") support which it’s natively provided by Neovim.

## Configuration

While _Command-T_ needs just a brief compilation, achievable automatically with most of the modern plugin managers ([vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug "vim-plug"), [neobundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim "NeoBundle")) and most of it’s features are ready to go (except if you want to extend present _wildignore_ configuration to blacklist files and directories), _Unite.vim_ needs to be configured from the ground up: basically every binding, setting and whatsoever needs to be written from scratch. That’s not a problem ‘per se’, but with a coincise documentation it could become somewhat of an annoyance.

> The following snippet is my configuration, be aware that you need [Ag](https://github.com/rking/ag.vim) and [theSliverSearcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) installed as a plugin and in your system respectively.

```
" Unite

let g:unite_source_history_yank_enable = 1
nnoremap <leader>t :<C-u>Unite -no-split -buffer-name=files   -start-insert file_rec/async:!<cr>
nnoremap <leader>f :<C-u>Unite -no-split -buffer-name=files   -start-insert file<cr>
nnoremap <leader>y :<C-u>Unite -no-split -buffer-name=yank    history/yank<cr>
nnoremap <leader>b :<C-u>Unite -no-split -buffer-name=buffer  buffer<cr>
nnoremap <leader>s :<C-u>Unite -buffer-name=grep grep<cr>

" Ignore
call unite#custom#source('file_rec/async,file', 'ignore_pattern', 'bower_components\|dist\|fonts\|node_modules\|maps\|\.png$\|\.jpg$\|\.svg$\|\.gif$')

" Configure Ag and use it instead of grep
let g:unite_source_grep_command = 'ag'
let g:unite_source_grep_default_opts =
\ '--line-numbers --nocolor --nogroup --hidden --ignore ' .
\  '''.hg'' --ignore ''.svn'' --ignore ''.git'' --ignore ''.bzr'''
let g:unite_source_grep_recursive_opt = ''
```

## Documentation

While _Command-T_ has a very exhaustive documentation, _Unite.vim_ one is quite technical and coincise. As i said earlier, it could become an annoyance, especially if the user is not quite skilled in *VimL* and doesn’t have a fairly strong grip on *Vim* mechanics. It means that probably, in the majority of cases, *Command-T* just need a couple of tweaks to fit in your workflow, while *Unite.vim* would require a longer process.

## Features

_Unite.vim_ has a large set of features that span from fuzzy file search and async search, grep (faster with the use of [theSilverSearcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher "theSilverSearcher") or [Ack2](https://github.com/petdance/ack2 "Ack2")) yank history, to buffer search, and even more.

_Command-T_ has an awesome set of features: from file and buffer search, jumplist, taglist and MRU buffer sorting, but it’s not as complete as it’s *Lua* counterpart.

## Speed

Speed is comparable, but in my opinion _Command-T_ overall is snappier, and after it’s first execution it’s usually faster thanks to it’s caching.

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://asciinema.org/a/16905.js" id="asciicast-16905" data-loop="true" async></script>

That doesn’t mean that _Unite_ is not fast enough for everyday use, but on large projects can be a tad slower.

## Conclusions

While *Command-T* is easier and overall faster, *Unite.vim* has more features and it’s more configurable. Both of them are an excellent choice, but if you'd like to use *Neovim*, i’m afraid that the choice has been already made for you.
