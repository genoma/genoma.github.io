The official [MacVim](https://code.google.com/p/macvim/) development has been mostly quiet for the past few months, and Björn Winckler has stated in this [post](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/vim_mac/-bd5RKGs8qw) that he will stop maintaining the project for lack of time.

My [MacVim fork](https://github.com/genoma/macvim) will be updated as soon as new [Vim](http://www.vim.org) patches are available, in the meaning time i’ll follow how MacVim development will procede [with the new maintainer](https://github.com/douglasdrumond/macvim).

A **new** [MacVim unofficial binary](https://github.com/genoma/macvim/releases/tag/g-snapshot-26) has been released yesterday with some enhancements and fixes to the linked libraries and it syncs with Vim at version 7.4.608.

If you encounter any problem with the binaries related to the build process (e.g. wrong linked libraries or similar) you can report it to the [issues](https://github.com/genoma/macvim/issues) section of the repository.
