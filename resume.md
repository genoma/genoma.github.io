### Personal profile:

I’ve started getting interested in web development and web design in late 90’s and i always have had a soft spot for beautifully designed websites. In past few years i’ve spent my time changing approach, from the classic web designer role to a more specifically crafted toward the front end, with focus on modern methodologies, languages and libraries, continuously learning and researching while keeping an eye on web design trends.

I’m searching for a challenging and dynamic job and work environment to further expand my experiences and knowledges in the front end development field.

My current focus is on Angular, Ajax, Javascript, the use of more effective and lighter front end frameworks (Susy, Compass, Breakpoint) and the development of jQuery plugins.

In my past experiences i’ve proven to be punctual, i’m strong willed, i love challenges and never give up until a work has been finished.

Aside for programming i love speed, Formula 1 and auto racing in general, action and sci-fi movies, 60’s to 80’s rock music, plus i have a soft spot for good cooking and Italian wine.
